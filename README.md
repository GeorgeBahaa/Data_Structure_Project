# Data_Structure_Project
XML (Extensible Markup Language) is one of the most famous formats for storing and sharing
information among different devices. Some text editors such as Sublime Text are able to parse
such files and do some basic operations. In this project, you will work on developing a GUI
(Graphical User Interface) based program to parse and visualize an XML file.

Each user has id (unique), name, list of posts, list of followers.
Each post has text and list of topics.
